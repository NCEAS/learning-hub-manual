The Delta Science Program partnered with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in the fall of 2021 to lead a collaborative synthesis working group. The synthesis working group delivered high-quality training in synthetic data science and statistical techniques and provided a focused opportunity for enhanced collaboration between scientists from federal and State agencies as well as academic scientists.
