Data science technologies complement interdisciplinary analyses of complex environmental issues ranging over many topics such as climate change, water and air pollution, policy analysis, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem management, biodiversity and many others. The curriculum is designed to prepare individuals to develop and use sophisticated analytical and computer-based methods to assess and protect the Earth’s natural resources.","The MS program in biological data science provides students with a foundation in biology and computational methods along with hands-on training through real-world projects at the interface of the natural and mathematical sciences.\nStudents learn to manipulate big data, including the generation and analysis of data using statistical and computational toolsets. Students use their analytical skills in ecological, environmental, toxicological and other biological applications. The program incorporates multiple levels of experiential learning to ensure students gain critical thinking skills in addition to core competencies.","In today’s world of big data, rapid technological change and natural resource scarcity, Earth scientists with data science expertise are in high demand. The Earth Data Analytics - Foundations professional graduate certificate is designed to provide students with a powerful combination of skills in earth science, data analytics, interdisciplinary collaboration and science communication.","Primarily focused on girls 3rd-12th grade, but has some programming for college and early career professionals. Active on IG about featuring really awesome coding professionals.","Our MSc Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning will educate future environmental scientists in data science, machine learning and associated computational technologies.\nThis course will deepen your knowledge of cutting-edge data science, machine learning and associated computational and observational techniques, and you will learn to apply this to a broad range of environmentally motivated applications.","[Not strictly focus on EDS] The program prepares graduates for professional careers at the interface of science, technology, and policy, including in industry, government, academia, regulatory agencies or consulting.","MIT Electrical Engineer who taught during Stanford's Coding in Place. He uploaded all his section lesson recordings on YouTube.","Core coursework provides learning opportunities in the foundations of informatics, programming and computer science, structuring large-scale data sets, machine learning, and statistical data analysis.","Stanford's volunteer-led course where over 900 teachers from around the world came together to teach over 10,000 students how to code in python. The program is over now, but there may be furture offerings.","[Not particularly Environmental] Data is everywhere. Continuously generated and collected across every domain, it is a vast and largely untapped resource of information with the potential to reveal insights about every aspect of our lives and the world we live in. However, the ability to uncover these insights is a highly specialized skill possessed by far too few.\nUBC’s Master of Data Science program was designed to address this workforce gap by equipping students with the technical skills, practical experience, and most importantly, the confidence to seize opportunities in an ever-expanding field.","The Geospatial Data Sciences field of study at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) prepares environmental professionals and researchers to develop and use analytical and computer-intensive data-science methods to assess and steward the Earth’s landscapes and natural resources to achieve a sustainable society. Students learn to apply geospatial data science and modeling principles and tools across fields as diverse as geography and land use, social sciences including environmental justice, policy analysis, business, sustainable systems, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem management, and coupled human-natural systems and environmental justice.","The Master of Urban Spatial Analytics is a one year graduate program that teaches students how to use spatial analysis and data science to address the most pressing public policy and city planning conundrums of our day. We are teaching the next generation of civic technologists. The one-year MUSA program combines coursework on GIS, spatial analysis, data science, statistics, R and python programming, data visualization and web-based mapping with world-class urban content coursework from across the University of Pennsylvania.","The industry-relevant curriculum gives you the skills to extract valuable insights from big data. In this program, you will learn expertise in statistical modeling, data management, machine learning, data visualization, software engineering, research design, data ethics, and user experience to meet the growing needs of industry, not-for-profits, government agencies, and other organizations.","The Environmental Observation and Informatics (EOI) named option integrates cross-cutting Earth observation, technologies, and big data analytics in one unique, 15-month, 32-credit program that combines hands-on, in-person training with distance learning. Our goal is to transform students' technical expertise into integrative synthesis and leadership in environmental observation and interpretation to advance organizational response to environmental change at local, regional, and global scales"],"link":["https://viterbigradadmission.usc.edu/programs/masters/msprograms/data-science/ms-in-environmental-data-science/","https://newcollege.asu.edu/masters-degrees-phds/majorinfo/ASBDSMS/graduate/false/58","https://earthlab.colorado.edu/earth-data-analytics-professional-graduate-certificate","https://girlswhocode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/4681185195291-Workforce-Programs-","https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/earth-science/environmental-data-science-machine-learning/","https://tpp.mit.edu/academics/tpp-sm-curriculum-2/","https://www.youtube.com/c/MITEECSman","https://nau.edu/school-of-informatics-computing-and-cyber-systems/ms-informatics/","https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/","https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/","https://seas.umich.edu/academics/master-science/geospatial-data-sciences","https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about","https://www.washington.edu/datasciencemasters/","https://guide.wisc.edu/graduate/environmental-studies/environmental-conservation-ms/environmental-conservation-environmental-observation-informatics-ms/#:~:text=The%20Environmental%20Observation%20and%20Informatics,person%20training%20with%20distance%20learning"]},"columns":[{"accessor":"program_title","name":"Program","type":"character","cell":[{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://viterbigradadmission.usc.edu/programs/masters/msprograms/data-science/ms-in-environmental-data-science/","target":"_blank"},"children":["Masters in Environmental Data Science"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://newcollege.asu.edu/masters-degrees-phds/majorinfo/ASBDSMS/graduate/false/58","target":"_blank"},"children":["Biological Data Science, MS"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://earthlab.colorado.edu/earth-data-analytics-professional-graduate-certificate","target":"_blank"},"children":["Earth Data Analytics Professional Graduate Certificate"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://girlswhocode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/4681185195291-Workforce-Programs-","target":"_blank"},"children":["Workforce Programs"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/earth-science/environmental-data-science-machine-learning/","target":"_blank"},"children":["MSc Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://tpp.mit.edu/academics/tpp-sm-curriculum-2/","target":"_blank"},"children":["MIT Technology and Policy Program"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/c/MITEECSman","target":"_blank"},"children":["Stanford Code in Place 2021 Playlist (on YouTube)"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://nau.edu/school-of-informatics-computing-and-cyber-systems/ms-informatics/","target":"_blank"},"children":["Informatics, Master of Science"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/","target":"_blank"},"children":["Code in Place"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/","target":"_blank"},"children":["Master of Data Science"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://seas.umich.edu/academics/master-science/geospatial-data-sciences","target":"_blank"},"children":["Masters in Geospatial Data Science"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about","target":"_blank"},"children":["Master of Urban Spatial Analytics"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://www.washington.edu/datasciencemasters/","target":"_blank"},"children":["Master of Science in Data Science"]},{"name":"a","attribs":{"href":"https://guide.wisc.edu/graduate/environmental-studies/environmental-conservation-ms/environmental-conservation-environmental-observation-informatics-ms/#:~:text=The%20Environmental%20Observation%20and%20Informatics,person%20training%20with%20distance%20learning","target":"_blank"},"children":["Environmental Conservation: Environmental Observation and Informatics, M.S."]}]},{"accessor":"organization","name":"Organization","type":"character","minWidth":110},{"accessor":"short_description","name":"Description","type":"character","minWidth":200},{"accessor":"link","name":"Link","type":"character","show":false}],"searchable":true,"defaultSorted":[{"id":"organization","desc":false}],"defaultPageSize":3,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"highlight":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"400d4ca88b29642d68f5085b2bf9ac2c"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
